## Events

### DOM communicates to JavaScript with Events
- Event types:
  - Mouse-related: mouse movement, button click, enter/leave element
  - Keyboard-related: down, up, press
  - Focus-related: focus in, focus out(blur)
  - Input field changed, Form submitted
  - Timer events
  - Miscellaneous:
    - Contens of an element has changed
    - Page loaded/unloaded
    - Image loaded
    - Uncaught exception

### Event handing
Creating an event handler: must specify 3 things:
- what happened: the event of interest 
- where it happened: an element of interest
- what to do: JavaScript to invoke when the event occurs on the element

### Specifying the JavaScript of an Event
- Option1: in the HTML 
`<div onclick="gotMouseClick('id42'); gotMouse=true;">...</div>`
- Option2: from JavaScript using the DOM
`element.onclick = mouseClick;` or `element.addEventListener("click", mouseClick);`
- Option3: Example of the powerful listener/emitter pattern

### Event Object
- Event listener functions passed an Event object
Typically sub-classed MouseEvent, KeyboardEvent, etc
- Some Event properties:
  - type - The name of the event ('click', 'mouseDown', 'keyUp', â€¦)
  - timeStamp - The time that the event was created
  - currentTarget - Element that listener was registered on
  - target - Element that dispatched the event

### MouseEvent and KeyboardEvent
- Some MouseEvent properties (prototype inherits from Event)
  - button - mouse button that was pressed
  - pageX, pageY: mouse position relative to the top-left
  corner of document
  - screenX, screenY: mouse position in screen coordinates
- Some KeyboardEvent properties (prototype inherits from Event)
  - keyCode: identifier for the keyboard key that was pressed
  Not necessarily an ASCII character!
  - charCode: integer Unicode value corresponding to keypress, if there is one.

### Draggable Rectangle - HTML/CSS
```html
<style type="text/css">
  #div1 {
    position: absolute;
  }
</style>

...
<div id="div1" onmousedown="mouseDown(event);"
onmousemove="mouseMove(event);"
onmouseup="mouseUp(event);">Drag Me!</div>
```

### Draggable Rectangle - JavaScript
```javascript
var isMouseDown = false; // Dragging?
var prevX, prevY;
function mouseDown(event) {
  prevX = event.pageX;
  prevY = event.pageY;
  isMouseDown = true;
}
function mouseUp(event) {
  isMouseDown = false;
}

function mouseMove(event) {
  if (!isMouseDown) {
    return;
  }
  var elem = document.getElementById("div1");
  elem.style.left = (elem.offsetLeft +
    (event.pageX - prevX)) + "px";
  elem.style.top = (elem.offsetTop +
    (event.pageY - prevY)) + "px";
  prevX = event.pageX;
  prevY = event.pageY;
}
```

### Deciding which handler(s) are invoked for an event?
- Complicating factor: elements can contain or overlap other elements 
Suppose user clicks with the mouse on "xyz" in:
```html
<body>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>xyz</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</body>
```
If I have handlers on the td, tr, table, and body elements which get called?
  - Sometimes only the innermost element should handle the
  event
  - Sometimes it's more convenient for an outer element to
  handle the event

### Capturing and Bubbling Events
- Capture phase (or "trickle-down"):
  - Start at the outermost element and work down to the innermost nested element
  - Each element can stop the capture, so that its children never see the event `event.stopPropagation()`
`element.addEventListener(eventType, handler, true);`
- Bubble phase - Most on handlers (e.g. onclick) use bubble, not onfocus/blur
  - Invoke handlers on the innermost nested element that dispatches the event (mostly right thing)
  - Then repeat on its parent, grandparent, etc. Any given element can stop the bubbling: `event.stopPropagation()`
`element.addEventListener(eventType, handler, false);`
- Handlers in the bubble phase more common than capture phase

### Example: Timer Events
- Run myfunc once, 5 seconds from now:
`token = setTimeout(myFunc, 5*1000);`
Function is called in specified number of milliseconds
- Run myfunc every 50 milliseconds:
`token = setInterval(myfunc, 50);`
- Cancel a timer:
`clearInterval(token);`
- Used for animations, automatic page refreshes, etc.

### Event Concurrency
- Events are serialized and processed one-at-a-time
- Event handling does not interleave with other Javascript execution.
  - Handlers run to completion
  - No multi-threading.
- Make reasoning about concurrency easier
  - Rarely need locks
- Background processing is harder than with threads

### Event-based programming is different
- Must wait for someone to invoke your code
- Must return quickly from the handler (otherwise the application will lock up).
- Key is to maintain control through events: make sure you have declared enough handlers; last resort is a timer
- Node.js uses event dispatching engine in JavaScript for server programming
