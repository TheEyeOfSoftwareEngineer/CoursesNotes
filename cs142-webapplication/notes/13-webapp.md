## Building Web Applications

### Good web applications: Design + Implementation
Some Design Goals:
- Intuitive to use
  - Don't need to take a course or read a user manual
- Accomplish task accurately and rapidly
  - Provide needed information and functionality
- Users like the experience
  - Joy rather than pain when using the app

The hardest part of good web applications is the design;
Good user interface principles are encoded in the toolkits and style guides

### Some guiding design principles for Web Apps
- Be consistent
Cognitive load less for the user
- Provide context
User shouldn't get lost in the app
- Be fast
Don't make the user wait

### Consistency: Style guides & design templates
- Web apps should have a style guide - Covers the look and feel of the app
  - Style - Color schemes, animation, icons, images, typography, writing
  - User interactions - Menu, buttons, pickers, dialog boxes, tables, lists, ...
  - Layout - Structure, toolbars, content, responsiveness

- Patterns - If you do something multiple places do it the same way
  - Aided by reusable implementation components
  - Error handling, navigation, notifications, etc.

- Design templates - Follow a familiar structure 
  - Example: Master-detail template

### Style Guide Example: Material Design from Google
- Used in Google apps (e.g Android, web apps)
  - Influence by publishing (paper and ink) enhance with technology (3D look)
  - Focus on traditional print issues: grids, space, typography, scale, color, imagery
  - Heavy use of animation to convey action 

- Dictates many aspect of design
  - Structure and layouts
  - User interface
  - Common patterns

### Material Design Foundations
- Environment - surfaces (e.g paper), depth, and shadows
- Layout - responsive layout grid, breakpoints, white space
- Navigation - changing views: Lateral, Forward, Backward
- Color - recommendations for colors that work well together
- Typography - recommendations for point size, weight, spacing
- Iconography - visual expressions (language independent)
- Shape - use different shapes to direct attention, identify, communicate
- Motion - show information (e.g. relationships), focus attention, fun
- Interaction - map touch to actions
- Communication - writing, formats, imagery, launch screen, onboarding

### Front-end web frameworks
- Popular example: Bootstrap
  - CSS style sheets
    - Design templates
    - Grid layout system with responsive support (breakpoints, etc.)
    - Element styling
  - HTML components
    - Buttons, menus, toolbars, lists, table, forms, etc.
  - JavaScript
    - Modals, transitions, dropdowns, etc.
    - Originally jquery based
- ReactJS no-opinion. Popular: Material-UI
  - CSS style sheets and components for implementing Material design spec
